Marshall Allen (He/Him) I grew up in the Midwest, Missouri specifically and I have worked a variety of human resource jobs. For a while I was at GEICO as HR personnel and before that, I worked as a campaign strategist for a mayor in the Kansas City Metro area. Outside of academia, my life is pretty boring--just the way I like it. While it may not look like it, my I spend a significant portion of my free time in the gym--in fact 6 days a week, you can find me there, the same way you'd find me in my home. My research interests are: protest, free speech, highways, constitutional law, statute enforcement, and legal inequality.
